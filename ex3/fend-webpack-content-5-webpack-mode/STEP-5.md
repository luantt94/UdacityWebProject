# Step 5 - Webpack Mode

In Webpack, there are two ways you can set the environment mode:

## #1. Through the CLI

```
webpack --mode=production
```

## #2. In the config

```
module.exports = {
  mode: 'production'
};
```

Projects will use either one. If using the CLI flag, you can create conditional statements in your webpack config that check the environment before adding a setting, like this:

```
if (argv.mode === 'development') {
    config.devtool = 'source-map';
  }
```

If you choose option 2 and declare mode in the webpack config, then you’ll have two webpack config files - one for dev and one for prod. 

From what I have seen, option 2 is a bit more common. And that is the way we’ll go.

Go ahead and rename the webpack config file we have to `webpack.dev.js` and create a new one, also at root, called `webpack.prod.js`. 

Add the correct mode flag to each one:

```
mode: "development"/"production"
```

We also have to edit our npm script to use the correct files we run `npm run build`. Your scripts will look like this:

```
    "build-prod": "webpack --config webpack.prod.js",
    "build-dev": "webpack --config webpack.dev.js"
```
